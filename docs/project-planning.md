# Application: StepQuest

## General Information

### Definition Statement

I want to build an app that allows users to track steps taken in the real world (either entered into the app or integrated with another fitness tracker via api) as a virtual journey across a fantasy realm. This could be via a predefined route in an existing universe (ie. journey across Middle-Earth) or through custom content created by the user.

### Audience
The audience for this application is anyone who is interested in being more mindful about their fitness journey. With a simple interface and the ability to adapt it to different universes via custom quests, it would be open to fans of various genres. This is less for serious fitness enthusiasts and more for a casual user looking to be active in a fun way.

## Background Research

### Similar Applications
- Fantasy Hike - https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fantasy-hike/id1557127861
    - **What I like**: Beautiful interface. Simple aesthetic without a lot of unnecessary bells and whistles.
    - **What I don’t like**: Not customizable and limited to one journey (from Lord of the Rings).

- The Conqueror Challenges - https://www.theconqueror.events/
   - **What I like**: Lots of challenge options from both fantasy universes (Lord of the Rings, Star Wars) as well as real-life hikes (Appalachian trail, Great Wall of China)
   - **What I don’t like**: Heavily promotes physical rewards for completing challenges (ie. medals, postcards) which comes with a hefty pricetag.

- Walkr - https://sparkful.app/walkr
    - **What I like**: I like the gamified elements where steps can be used as a form of currency in the game.
    - **What I don’t like**: Single theme. Steps are a resource rather than progress along a journey.


### SWOT Analysis
1. Strengths -
    1. **Customizable** - Ability for users to create their own journeys rather than simply rely on paths that are officially released. This allows for content to expand quickly (since it's added by users) and enhances engagement as content is added in universes that appeal to particular fan communities.
    2. **Expandable** - Provides a base set functionality that can be easily expanded upon with additional features and content.
    3. **Engaging** - Gamified features combined with material from universes the users are already engaged in (or the opportunity to add this material) builds upon the existing passion of fan communities.
2. Weaknesses -
    1. **License issues** - official use of copyrighted material could cause issues if the app is widely released.
    2. **User Content** - User created content doesn’t have the same quality controls as official releases.
    3. **Competition** - With alternatives available, users will be more likely to stick to applications they are familiar with rather than try something new.
3. Opportunities -
    1. **Community engagement** - A key part of this app is the opportunity for users to create content for the app. This is not present in many similar applications which offer predefined experiences. This can both expand the content offered in the app and increase engagement with the content creators that are fueling this process.
   2. **Additional features** - Many opportunities exist to expand beyond core functionality with additional features such as player inventories, side quests, etc. Some of these could be monetized as “premium” features if desired.
   3. **Community-driven marketing** - Shared achievements or users promoting their created journeys naturally invites other users to try out the app.
4. Threats -
   1. **Crowded landscape** - There are several other applications that offer similar functionality and step tracking.
   2. **API reliance** - While step tracking can be entered manually, integration with existing trackers (like phones/watches) relies on the api integration with these devices which could be complex and change over time.
   3. **Lack of long-term user engagement** - without new features and challenges users may not stay engaged with the application long term.

## Define Content of Application
### Navigation
The home page will provide a brief description of the app and its features and ultimately direct the user to log in or register. Once logged in, the user will be able to navigate to the core functions of the app: tracking daily progress on a journey, viewing a log of accumulated steps, selecting or creating a journey, and a community page with leaderboards and achievements. These will be accessible via a menu at the bottom of the page or a drop down menu in desktop. The functionality of each page is further outlined in the user story map and wireframe diagrams.

### Font
Given the fantasy nature of the application I plan to use a hand-written font such as Bilbo https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bilbo. Perhaps if a journey is utilizing a science-fiction theme a different font could be used, for example https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Orbitron.

### Colors
I found this as a possible palette to use: https://colorswall.com/palette/262369
